"""
Vault model — the top-level container for a campaign or world.

A Vault holds all notes, characters, maps, folders, and assets for one
campaign. Users can own multiple vaults (e.g., one per campaign). The
owner is always a single user; additional members are granted access
via the members list and permissions dict.

Multiuser: members list + permissions dict support DM-owned vaults with
player access, shared worldbuilding vaults, and solo play.
