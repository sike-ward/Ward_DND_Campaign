"""
Character model — PCs, NPCs, monsters, and any named entity in the world.

Characters belong to a Vault and are always owned by a User (even NPCs
are owned by the GM's user account). The is_npc flag distinguishes
player characters from GM-controlled entities.

Multiuser: group_id and permissions support party-level visibility,
e.g., a GM can mark an NPC's secrets as GM-only.
