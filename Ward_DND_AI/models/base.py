"""
Ward DND AI — Core base model.

All data models inherit from CoreModel to guarantee a consistent
set of fields across every entity in the system. This is the single
source of truth for shared metadata — do not duplicate these fields
in subclasses.

Multiuser design notes:
- owner_id: the user who created / owns this record
- Every resource is scoped; nothing exists outside an owner context
- last_modified should be updated on every write via storage layer

    Shared base for every Ward DND AI data model.

    Fields
    ------
    id : str
        Globally unique UUID4. Generated automatically on creation.
    schema_version : int
        Incremented when the model's field layout changes, enabling
        safe migrations. Never change a record's schema_version manually.
    owner_id : str
        ID of the User who created / owns this record. Required on all
        resources to support multiuser permission checks.
    created_at : datetime
        UTC timestamp set once at creation. Never modified afterward.
    last_modified : datetime
        UTC timestamp updated every time the record is saved. The
        storage layer is responsible for keeping this current.
