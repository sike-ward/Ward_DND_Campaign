"""
User model — an account in the Ward DND AI system.

Users own vaults, notes, and all other resources. Authentication is
handled separately (auth module); this model only stores account state.
Passwords are always stored as hashes — never plaintext.

Multiuser: users belong to groups, carry roles, and are the root of
the permission hierarchy. Every CoreModel record references a user via
owner_id.
