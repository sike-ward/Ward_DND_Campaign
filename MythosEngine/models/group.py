"""
Group model — a party, campaign group, or collaboration team.

Groups tie multiple users together with shared access to vaults and
content. A user can belong to many groups. Groups support named roles
(e.g., GM, player, observer) for future fine-grained permission work.

Multiuser: this is the primary mechanism for shared campaigns.
